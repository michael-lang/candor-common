This project is archived.

There are some patterns in here still relevant today (May 2021), but many are out of date and replaced by new features of .Net Core.

Of note, Dependency Injection is built-in to .Net Core and is preferred over Provider Model in this repo.

The code related to sequence ID generation in a database that does not have it built in, is still relevant in 2021.

Some of the password hashing concepts are still valid, but you may be better served by using the Identity libraries built-in to .Net Core.
